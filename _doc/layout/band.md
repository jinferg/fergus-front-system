## Band

The band layout is useful when you require a layout container that spans the full width of the browser window. Often you will see sites with alternating white and shaded rows, this is a perfect example of how the band layout is used.

<section class="l-band -shade u-pad-y-large">
</section>
<section class="l-band -shade-heavy u-pad-y-large">
</section>

```html
<section class="l-band -shade">
  ...
</section>

<section class="l-band -shade-heavy">
  ...
</section>
```

### Backgrounds

To change the color of the band you can use the following modifiers.

<section class="l-band -white u-pad-y-large">
</section>
<section class="l-band -brand u-pad-y-large">
</section>
<section class="l-band -accent  u-pad-y-large">
</section>
<section class="l-band -shade-light u-pad-y-large">
</section>
<section class="l-band -shade u-pad-y-large">
</section>
<section class="l-band -shade-hard u-pad-y-large">
</section>

```html
<section class="l-band -white">
  ...
</section>
<section class="l-band -brand">
  ...
</section>
<section class="l-band -accent">

</section>
<section class="l-band -shade-light">
